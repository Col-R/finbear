# 🐻 Finbear

**Finbear** is a modern, fullstack investment dashboard built with the best tools and a clear purpose:

> To make portfolio tracking insightful, secure, and genuinely fun — plus its a good way for the developer, Cole, to show off a bit.

## ✨ Vision

Finbear empowers users to:
- Securely log in to their own account
- Add holdings with ticker, cost basis, and share count
- Pull real-time stock prices and historical data
- View total portfolio value and gain/loss over time
- Ask natural-language questions to an AI-powered portfolio coach (coming soon)

Finbear isn't just another finance app — it's a demonstration of how **modern fullstack architecture** can meet **clear product goals** and stay delightful along the way.
