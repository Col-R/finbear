Next few PRs:
User Session Context - Get the logged-in user’s data from the DB. This will let pages know who is logged in and simplify queries like “get this user’s portfolios.”
    - Create a getUserFromSession() helper using createServerClient(). 
    - Fetch the user’s full DB record (email, id, etc) via their auth.user.id.
    - Make it available to pages via props or context.
Dashboard Shell + Layout - Set up the base layout for authenticated pages.
    - Create a /dashboard/layout.tsx and /dashboard/page.tsx.
    - Add a left nav (even if placeholder), header, and protected content section.
    - Use middleware.ts to protect the entire dashboard route.
    - Optionally display the user’s email or a welcome message

Portfolio Details & Positions CRUD
    - New route: /dashboard/portfolio/[id] (Server Component).
    - Show portfolio meta + table of positions.
    - Actions: addPosition, updatePosition, deletePosition (Zod validate: ticker, shares, costBasis).
    - Acceptance: can add/edit/delete positions; RLS prevents cross-user access (verify with SQL editor or a second account).

Market Data Adapter (MVP)
    - Choose provider (simple to start): Polygon/yahoo finance.
    - Implement lib/quotes/provider.ts with getQuote(ticker) -> { price, currency, asOf }, add a 30–60s in-memory TTL cache to avoid rate limits.
    - Compute portfolio totals in lib/portfolio/math.ts (current value, P/L absolute and %).
    - Acceptance: dashboard shows current total value and P/L with live prices.

Polish & Tests
    - Toasts for action success/failure (shadcn use-toast).
    - Unit tests for math utils; light integration test of actions.
    - Error/empty/loading states across dashboard & detail pages.
